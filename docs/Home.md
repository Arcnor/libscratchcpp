**libscratchcpp** is a library for building C++ based Scratch project players.

It provides an API for reading and running Scratch projects which makes it easy
to create a GUI application that runs Scratch projects.

The idea is to implement Scratch blocks in C++ to build a fast project player
that is faster than Scratch modifications such as TurboWarp.

## NOTE
This library is still in development and it shouldn't be used
to build complete Scratch project players yet.

**There might be incompatible API changes anytime before version 1.0.0 releases!**
